# Bone Fracture Detection Model

This project demonstrates the development of a machine learning model to predict bone fractures from medical images. The model is trained using a dataset of X-ray images and uses deep learning to identify whether a bone fracture is present.

## Features

- **Image Upload for Prediction**: Users can upload an X-ray image to predict if a bone fracture is present.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained on a dataset of labeled bone X-ray images.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: The model achieves 85% accuracy in detecting bone fractures.
